            the Karmouz district in the western part of the city. The name "Kom El Shoqafa" is <br>
            derived from the ancient Greek name "Locus Kerameikos," referring to the area’s historibrcal <br> 
            association with pottery shards. The site was originally part of Rakotis, the ancient <br>

                The tomb is of the "Catacomb" style, a type of underground burial site common in the first <br>
